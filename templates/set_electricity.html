<h1>Electricity</h1>
<p>Although you can run most modern machines now on standard 1phase (single
phase) you will have a much wider choice on equipment (if you decide to use
reconditioned machines) most of these will be 3phase 415volts. Again check with
your machine specifications and your local supplier.</p>
